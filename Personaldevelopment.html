            <p> Chapter 4 revolves around a conversation between Michael and Charlie, two maintenance men at Twelve Pillars. During their coffee break at Mack's Diner, they discuss the significance of goal-setting and effective time management. Inspired by Mr. Davis's teachings, Charlie emphasizes the transformative power of setting and achieving goals. He suggests breaking down larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps. </p>

            <p > In chapter 5, Charlie highlights the importance of prioritizing the urgent over the important and designing one's life plan. Charlie emphasizes "the pain of discipline versus the pain of regret," arguing that regret can be a heavy burden at the end of life, and effective time management is crucial to avoid this. </p>

            <p > The conversation shifts to the influence of relationships on personal and professional growth in chapter 6. Charlie emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with positive and successful people. He urges individuals to evaluate the impact of their relationships on their lives, by asking themselves important questions like "Who am I around? What effect are they having on me? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask themselves the big question: Is that okay?"</p>

            <p>Finally, in chapter 7 Charlie discusses the significance of lifelong learning. He highlights the role of self-education in personal and professional growth, recommending reading books, learning from successful people, and reflecting on experiences.</p>

<p> 
I can apply the lessons from Chapters 4 to 7 of Twelve Pillars by focusing on goal setting, time management, building a supportive network, and lifelong learning to enhance my academic and personal life. I can start by defining clear, meaningful goals that reflect my values and structure my time around these goals by creating a schedule that balances study, self-care,and social activities. Also, I can cultivate supportive relationships by engaging with motivated peers and mentors to share experiences and support each other. Finally, I can embrace lifelong learning by staying curious beyond the classroom. Read widely and explore subjects that interest me, apply what I learn in practical ways, whether through class projects or personal initiatives and strive to grow academically and personally.
